# 💼 Soroban Job Marketplace Smart Contract

A secure, milestone-based smart contract for job management and payments on **Soroban**, Stellar's smart contract platform.

This contract ensures:

- Funds are locked upfront
- Payments are released automatically per milestone
- A future-proof structure for dispute resolution

---

## 📌 4.1 Job Creation & Fund Locking

### ✅ Job Creation

- The **Client** (employer) creates a job and defines a series of milestones.
- Each milestone has a specific deliverable and a set **payment amount**.

### 🔒 Fund Locking

- During job creation, the **full job budget** is locked into the smart contract.
- This guarantees that the funds are available **before** the work starts, ensuring trust and preventing disputes or fraud.

---

## 🛠️ 4.2 Talent Selection & Work Submission

### 👥 Talent Selection

- A **Talent** (freelancer) applies for a job.
- The **Client** selects a Talent, and the contract records the selection.

### 📤 Work Submission

- The Talent completes the first milestone and submits their work for review.

### ✔️ Client Approval

- The Client reviews the work.
- Upon approval, the smart contract is notified to release the associated milestone payment.

---

## 💸 4.3 Milestone-Based Payment Release

### ⚙️ Automatic Payments

- Once a milestone is approved, the smart contract **automatically** sends the corresponding funds to the **Talent’s wallet**.

### 🎯 Final Payment

- The final milestone triggers the **last payment**, marking the job as complete.

### 🔐 Trustless System

- All payments are **automated**.
- No manual transfers are needed after funds are locked—**both parties must follow contract rules**.

---

## 🛡️ 4.4 Dispute Resolution (Future Feature)

### ⚖️ Conflict Resolution

- If issues arise (e.g., a Client refuses approval or a Talent feels mistreated), a **dispute** can be triggered.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Arbitrators

- Trusted **third-party arbitrators** (or DAO members) will review the situation and deliver a judgment.

### 📜 Binding Decisions

- The smart contract will **follow the arbitrators’ verdict**—either releasing the funds to the Talent or returning them to the Client.
