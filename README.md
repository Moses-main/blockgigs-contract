Soroban Milestone-Based Job Smart Contract
This smart contract is designed for a secure and decentralized job marketplace on Soroban, Stellar's smart contract platform. It enables trustless collaboration between Clients and Talents by enforcing milestone-based payments, fund locking, and a future-ready dispute resolution system.

🛠️ Features Overview
✅ Milestone-based job creation

🔒 Upfront fund locking for trust

🤝 Talent selection and job linking

🔁 Automated milestone payments

⚖️ (Planned) Dispute resolution mechanism

📌 4.1 Job Creation & Fund Locking
1. Job Creation
The Client creates a job and defines its milestones, where each milestone includes:

A description of the task

A payment amount tied to that milestone

2. Fund Locking
Upon job creation:

The full job budget is locked in the smart contract

Ensures payment availability before work begins

Prevents fraud or disputes later on

📌 4.2 Talent Selection & Work Submission
1. Talent Selection
Talents (freelancers) can apply for listed jobs

Once selected, the Client assigns the Talent, and the smart contract binds them to the job

2. Work Submission
Talents submit completed milestones

Work is submitted via the platform

3. Client Approval
Client reviews the milestone

If satisfied, the Client approves, and the smart contract initiates payment

📌 4.3 Milestone-Based Payment Release
1. Automatic Payments
Once a milestone is approved, the smart contract automatically releases the corresponding funds to the Talent

2. Final Payment
Final milestone triggers the completion of the contract

Full payment is made without manual intervention

3. Trustless Transfers
Payments are fully automated

Neither party can interfere with the locked funds outside of the contract rules

🧑‍⚖️ 4.4 Dispute Resolution (Coming Soon)
1. Conflict Handling
If there's a dispute (e.g., a Client refuses approval or Talent claims unfairness), a dispute process will be triggered

2. Arbitrator Role
A third-party Arbitrator (DAO or trusted party) reviews the case

Arbitrators are given temporary authority

3. Binding Decision
The smart contract obeys the arbitrator’s ruling

Funds are either sent to the Talent or refunded to the Client

🔮 Future Enhancements
DAO-based arbitration selection

On-chain feedback and review system

Talent scoring and job ratings
